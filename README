*  Basic: Given a string s1, does another string s2, exist inside it? If so,
*return the index of s1 where s2 starts, or -1 if s2 not present.
*
*  Some twists: various ways of doing it. One way -- s2 is a string. Turn the
*part of s1 you think might contain s2 into a string, then compare strings. I
* would be build on past programs.
